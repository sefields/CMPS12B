This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Taoh Green (tmgreen@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Sam Fields (sefields@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Taoh Green spent      1 hours working alone.
Sam Fields spent     1 hours working alone.
We spent              24 hours working together.
Taoh Green spent       12 hours driving.
Sam Fields spent      12 hours driving.
