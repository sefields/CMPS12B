          NAME

              jroff - format documents for display on line printer

          SYNOPSIS

              jroff [filename...]

          DESCRIPTION

              `jroff' formats text according to control lines embedded in
              the text of the given input files.  Control lines begin with
              a period (.) in column 1 and all other lines are text lines
              to be formatted.  Paragraphs are delimited by empty lines or
              control lines.

          OPTIONS

              None.

          OPERANDS

              All operands are filenames.  Each file is read in turn as
              input to the formatter.  If a filename is specified as a
              minus sign (-), the standard input is read at that point.  If
              no filenames are given, the standard input is read.  The
              formatted document is written to the standard output.

          EXIT STATUS

              0
                  No errors were encountered.
              1
                  One or more files were not found or invalid commands were
                  found.  Error messages were written to the standard
                  error.

          INPUT TEXT

              Input lines are of three types:  empty lines, which cause a
              paragraph to be terminated and are equivalent to the `.sp'
              command;  text lines, which are added to the current
              paragraph, and commands, which being with a period (.) in
              column 1.  White space is ignored, except as separators.
              Whenever a word of output is printed, it is followed by one
              space unless it is at the end of a sentence.  A word is at
              the end of a sentence if its last character is one of the
              characters period (.), question (?), bang (!), colon(:), or
              semi-colon (;).

          COMMANDS

              The following commands are recognized.  Whenever an operand
              of `N' is specified on a command, the operand must be
              numeric, and if missing, the default value is used.  `C'
              indicates a single character operand.

              .\" anything
                  `jroff' comments are ignored and are useful for private
                  documentation purposes.

              .bp
                  Begin page, causing a break.  Write a form feed (^L)
                  character immediately before printing the page header for
                  the next page.  When the next paragraph is dumped, The
                  page title will be printed when the next line after this
                  is printed.

              .br
                  Break.  The paragraph is dumped and a new paragraph is
                  begun.  There is no empty line between paragraphs.  Same
                  as `.sp 0'.

              .cc C
                  Sets the control character to C.  The control character
                  is that which appears in position 0 of the input line to
                  signal a command.  Default:  `.'.

              .in N
                  Set the indentation to N characters.  This is the number
                  of spaces printed at the beginning of each line in
                  addition to the page offset.  Also causes a break (.br).
                  Default:  0.

              .ll N
                  Set output line length to N characters.  The indentation
                  is included in this, but not the page offset.  Default:
                  65.

              .mt N
                  Specifies the margin at the top of the page in lines.
                  The title is vertically centered in this margin.  N/2
                  empty lines are printed, then the title, then N/2-1 empty
                  lines.  Default:  0.

              .tl 'left'mid'right'
                  A three part page header may be specified for the left,
                  middle, and right side of the page.  If a percent (%)
                  appears anywhere in the title, it is replaced by a page
                  number.  The left part is left justified within the
                  output line, the right part is right justified, and the
                  mid part is centered one the entire output line.
                  Default:

              .pl N
                  Set the page length to N lines.  Whever this many lines
                  have been output, a page eject occurs, and the page
                  header is printed immediately before printing the next
                  line of text.  Default:  60.

              .po N



                                                                          4


                  Page offset is N characters.  This is the number of space
                  characters printed at the beginning of every output line.
                  No characters are printed if the line is empty.  Default:
                  10.

              .sp N
                  End a paragraph and print N blank lines.  Each blank
                  input line is the same as `.sp 1'.  If N is more than the
                  number of output lines left on the current page, behaves
                  exactly like `.bp'.  Default:  1.

          BUGS

              Very few commands have been implemented, the most serious
              being the lack of a macro preprocessor in order to make
              typing in the markup language less tedious.
