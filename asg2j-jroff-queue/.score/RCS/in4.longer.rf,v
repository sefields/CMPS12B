This document has a page length of 20 lines and so should produce
several pages.
Note the page eject after the first para.

This is a very simple example of some text that should be formatted.
As the lines are fetched form the input,
the output lines are adjusted so that each line is approximately
the same length.
.bp

.\"-- these comments should not appear in the output
.\"-- no comment
.\"-- Any line beginning with .\" is completely ignored.
Note that a blank line produces a paragraph break.
So we can easily use this as a primitiver formatter just like
fmt(1),
even if we don't want to do anything complicated.

The present assignment does not require that any line justification
be given.
Neither need any fancy PostScript formatting output be done.
Note that there is one space between words except when a word
ends a sentence.
A sentence ends when the word ends with one of the following
punctuation marks:
?!;:.

Many text formatters also allow for both right justification
rather than ragged right typesetting and also for hyphenation.
We do not require that here.
Also not that while sentence-ending punctuation works,
abbreviations ending with periods are treated as ending sentences,
which is not quite right.
And if we're not careful in formatting things,
very-long-words-which-appear-in-the-wrong place can cause
funny-looking line-breaking.
