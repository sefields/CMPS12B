    (3) checksource:  3 pts if <= 5 complaints;
        2 pts for 6 to 15 complaints;
        1 pt for 16 to 30 complaints; 0 pts if >30.

    (3) Proper formatting, indentation.
        no 1-letter idents.  all idents are meaningful.

    (3) function xref_file modified to reference bstree and
        spurious print statement deleted

    (3) Normal output is printed by main's wordvisitor, and
        no print statements in treemap's do_visits

    (3) Uses iterator form of for loop in class printer to print
        the queue

    Are each of the following functions properly coded and
    reasonably readable and complete?

    (3) treemap.get

    (3) treemap.put

    (3) debug_dump, debug_dump_rec

    (3) do_visit, do_visit_rec

    (3) queue.insert
